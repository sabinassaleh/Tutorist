# Tutorist
Capstone Project: Saba Saleh

Tutorist is an android application that essentially finds tutors for students who are in need of help in certain subjects. Students and tutors may register and log back in to a dashboard that displays tutors for students, and where tutors can change their subject of choice. 

This repo includes the activity files that are interconnected to make-up the main functionality of the graphic interface class. 
It also includes the XML files that create each frame within the application.
